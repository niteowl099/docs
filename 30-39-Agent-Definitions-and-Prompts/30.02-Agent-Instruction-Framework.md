# 30.02: Agent Instruction & Prompt Framework

ID: 30.02  
Status: Active  
Version: 1.0.0  
Tags: [agents, prompts, orchestration, standards]

## 1.0 Overview

This document defines the strategic framework for creating, organizing, and utilizing instruction and prompt files to steer the IDE-native AI agents (GitHub Copilot, Gemini Code Assist). The primary goal is to create a system of "text-based agents" that are version-controlled, auditable, and capable of performing complex tasks by leveraging the full context of our "Documentation-as-Truth" repository.
This framework addresses two core challenges:

1. **Context & Persistence:** Overcoming the inherent limitations of LLM context windows by using "live files" as external memory for tasks.
2. **Modularity vs. Accessibility:** Balancing the need for a clean, modular library of prompts with the IDE agents' need for context files in specific locations (e.g., .github/).

## 2.0 Core Principles

### 2.1 Instructions as Executable Plans

Each .md file within the docs/30-39/instructions/ directory represents an executable plan for an agent. These are not just descriptions; they are sequential, step-by-step guides that a developer, acting as the orchestrator, will feed to the AI assistant.

### 2.2 Prompts as Reusable Functions

Each .md file within the docs/30-39/prompts/ directory is a reusable, parameterized function. These templates will be referenced by instruction files or used directly to ensure consistency for common tasks like generating tests or documentation.

### 2.3 The "Live Task File" for Persistence

To ensure task persistence and adherence, every agentic operation initiated by an instruction file must create a corresponding "live task file" in a temporary workspace directory (e.g., .workspace/tasks/).

* **Purpose:** This file acts as the agent's short-term memory for a specific task, tracking its state and overcoming context window limitations.
* **Content:** The live task file will contain:
  * The original goal from the instruction file.
  * The agent's generated plan to achieve the goal.
  * A checklist of steps, marked as complete or pending.
  * The output or result of each completed step.
  * Any errors encountered and attempts to fix them.
* **Workflow:** At the beginning of each interaction, the developer will instruct the agent: "Resume work on the task defined in .workspace/tasks/task-001.md. Review the plan and the last completed step, then proceed to the next action." This ensures the agent always has the full context of the ongoing task.

## 3.0 Strategy for Context Accessibility

A key challenge is making the modular library of instructions and prompts (stored neatly in docs/) available to IDE agents that expect context in specific root-level directories like .github/ or GEMINI.md.

### 3.1 The "Single Source of Truth"

The docs/ directory, organized by the Johnny.Decimal system, remains the **single source of truth**. All prompts and instructions will be authored, edited, and version-controlled here. The files in the root-level directories are considered build artifacts.

### 3.2 The Sync-and-Reference Strategy

We will use a combination of file synchronization and referencing to solve the accessibility problem.

1. **Master Context Files:** The root-level .github/copilot-instructions.md and GEMINI.md files will serve as high-level "master" context files. They will contain the most critical, global constitutional principles and, crucially, act as an index that links to the specific instruction and prompt files within the docs/ repository.

   * Example for copilot-instructions.md:
     **Copilot Master Instructions**
     **Always adhere to the principles in (docs/10-19-Architecture-and-Design/10.01-System-Constitution.md).**
     **For creating new components, follow the plan in (docs/30-39-Agent-Definitions-and-Prompts/instructions/create-new-component.md).**

2. **Dedicated Prompt Directories:** Both GitHub Copilot and Gemini Code Assist allow for specifying custom directories for prompts and instructions. We will configure VS Code's settings (settings.json) to point directly to our canonical docs/30-39/prompts and docs/30-39/instructions directories. This is the preferred method as it avoids file duplication.
3. **Automated Syncing (Fallback):** If direct path configuration proves insufficient or buggy, a simple file synchronization script will be implemented. This script, triggered on a Git pre-commit hook or manually, will copy the contents of the docs/30-39/... directories into the respective .github/prompts or other required locations. This ensures the "build artifacts" are always up-to-date with the source of truth. VS Code extensions like "File Sync" can also be used for this purpose.

This hybrid approach ensures our prompt library is well-organized and modular, while still being fully accessible to the IDE agents in the format and location they expect.
