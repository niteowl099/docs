# 30.01: VS Code Agent Definitions

**ID:** 30.01
**Status:** Active
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Tags:** [agents, orchestration, prompts]

## 1.0 Overview

This document defines the roles, responsibilities, and operational instructions for the "VS Code Agents" that form the core of this development ecosystem. These are not standalone applications but rather personae and workflows enacted by the developer-in-the-loop, guiding the IDE-native AI assistants (GitHub Copilot, Gemini Code Assist) using a structured set of instruction and prompt files.

This approach ensures that we leverage the full power of our subscription-based models while maintaining a persistent, auditable, and version-controlled definition of our agentic logic.

## 2.0 Core Agent Roster

### 2.1 `BootstrapAgent`

*   **Role:** The initial setup and scaffolding agent.
*   **Primary AI Assistant:** GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode).
*   **Core Instructions:**
    *   `(../20-29-MVS-Bootstrap-and-Implementation/20.01-MVS-Bootstrap-Instructions.md)`
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Initialize new project repositories.
    *   Create the standard directory structure based on the Unified Knowledge Framework.
    *   Scaffold initial documentation and configuration files.

### 2.2 `DocuAgent` (The Librarian)

*   **Role:** Manages the "Documentation-as-Truth" knowledge base. Responsible for creating, updating, and ensuring the consistency of all documentation.
*   **Primary AI Assistant:** Gemini Code Assist (leveraging its large context window for document analysis).
*   **Core Instructions & Prompts:**
    *   `instructions/create-new-doc.md`
    *   `prompts/generate-c4-diagram.md`
    *   `prompts/summarize-research.md`
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Generate new documentation files adhering to the UKF standards.
    *   Create and update C4 diagrams in Mermaid syntax based on architectural descriptions.
    *   Refactor existing documentation for clarity and compliance with standards.
    *   Ingest raw research notes and synthesize them into structured, atomic knowledge files.

### 2.3 `CodeAgent` (The Implementer)

*   **Role:** The primary agent for writing, refactoring, and testing application code.
*   **Primary AI Assistant:** GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode) for its strong code generation and multi-file editing capabilities.
*   **Core Instructions & Prompts:**
    *   `instructions/create-new-component.md`
    *   `prompts/generate-unit-tests.md`
    *   `prompts/refactor-to-pattern.md`
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Implement new features based on specifications detailed in an instruction file.
    *   Refactor existing code to adhere to design patterns defined in the knowledge base.
    *   Generate unit tests with high coverage for new and existing code.
    *   Debug code by analyzing error logs and test failures, leveraging the `autoFix` capabilities of the IDE agents.

### 2.4 `ResearchAgent`

*   **Role:** Gathers and synthesizes external information to be fed into the knowledge base.
*   **Primary AI Assistant:** Gemini Advanced Pro (Web UI) for its "Deep Research" feature.
*   **Core Instructions & Prompts:**
    *   `prompts/conduct-deep-research.md`
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Execute complex research queries on new technologies, libraries, or problem domains.
    *   Summarize findings from multiple web sources into a coherent preliminary report.
    *   Identify key concepts, entities, and relationships for later ingestion into the knowledge graph.
    *   **Handoff:** The output of the `ResearchAgent` is a raw text or Markdown file that is then passed to the `DocuAgent` for formal ingestion into the knowledge base.
