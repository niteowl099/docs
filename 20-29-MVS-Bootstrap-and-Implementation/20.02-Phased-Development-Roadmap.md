# Phased Development Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach to building and implementing the AI-Assisted Development Ecosystem, as derived from the strategic plan.

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup (Complete)

*   **Objective:** Establish the core documentation structure and version control.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Initialize Git repository.
    *   Define core architectural principles (arc42, C4).
    *   Establish documentation standards (Johnny.Decimal, Zettelkasten).
    *   Create initial agent definitions and prompts.
    *   Transfer the initial Strategic Plan from Google Docs.

## Phase 2: MVS Bootstrap and Core Component Implementation

*   **Objective:** Build the Minimum Viable System (MVS) and implement the first core components.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Implement the API Router.
    *   Develop the initial Knowledge Graph.
    *   Refine agent instructions and prompts based on initial use.
    *   Bootstrap the system using the instructions in `20.01-MVS-Bootstrap-Instructions.md`.

## Phase 3: Workflow Automation and Integration

*   **Objective:** Automate key development and documentation workflows.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Implement the GDoc ingestion workflow.
    *   Automate component creation and testing.
    *   Integrate the system with external tools and APIs.

## Phase 4: Governance and Optimization

*   **Objective:** Establish governance models and optimize the system for cost and performance.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Implement API usage monitoring and governance.
    *   Refine the economic model based on usage data.
    *   Optimize agent performance and resource allocation.
