### **Step 1: Initialize Git Repository**

**Instruction to Agent:**
"Initialize a new Git repository in the current root directory (`C:\Users\aweld\Git\docs`). Create an initial commit with the message 'Initial commit: Setup project structure'."

### **Step 2: Create Core Directories**

**Instruction to Agent:**
"Create the following directory structure in the project root, following the Johnny.Decimal system. Do not create any files yet, only the directories."

### **Step 3: Create Foundational Documentation Files**

Instruction to Agent:
"Create the following empty Markdown files in their respective directories. I will provide the content for them later."

1. docs/00-09-System-Core-and-Meta/00.00-README.md
2. docs/10-19-Architecture-and-Design/10.01-System-Constitution.md
3. docs/10-19-Architecture-and-Design/10.02-Documentation-Standards.md
4. docs/20-29-MVS-Bootstrap-and-Implementation/20.01-MVS-Bootstrap-Instructions.md (This file)
5. docs/30-39-Agent-Definitions-and-Prompts/30.01-Agent-Definitions.md
6. docs/30-39-Agent-Definitions-and-Prompts/instructions/create-new-component.md
7. docs/30-39-Agent-Definitions-and-Prompts/prompts/generate-unit-tests.md
8. .github/copilot-instructions.md
9. GEMINI.md

### **Step 4: Populate Initial Files**

Instruction to Agent:
"Now, I will provide the content for each file. Please open each file one by one and paste the content I provide."
*(At this point, you would copy and paste the content from the other documents I've generated into their respective files, guided by the AI assistant.)*

**Reference:** See [00.00-README.md](../00-09-System-Core-and-Meta/00.00-README.md) for project overview and structure rationale.
---
### **Step 5: Create .gitignore**

Instruction to Agent:
"Create a .gitignore file in the project root. Add entries for common Python and Node.js project artifacts, such as __pycache__/, *.pyc, node_modules/, .env, and any local database storage directories like chroma_data/."

### **Step 6: Final Commit**

Instruction to Agent:
"Stage all the new files and directories and create a new Git commit with the message 'feat: Initial project scaffolding and documentation framework'."

Verification:
After these steps are complete, the repository will have the foundational structure and documentation necessary to begin Phase 1B.
