# 10.02: Documentation Standards and Unified Knowledge Framework

## 1.0 Overview

This document defines the Unified Knowledge Framework (UKF) for all documentation within this ecosystem. Adherence to these standards is mandatory to ensure all knowledge is human-readable, machine-parsable, and can serve as the single source of truth for our AI agents.

## 2.0 The Unified Knowledge Framework (UKF)

The UKF integrates four methodologies to provide a multi-layered structure for our knowledge base.

### 2.1 Physical Layout: Johnny.Decimal

All files and directories in this repository MUST be organized using the Johnny.Decimal system (AREA.CATEGORY.ID).

* Structure: docs/AREA-XX-XX/CATEGORY.ID_Description/
* Example: docs/10-19-Architecture-and-Design/11.01_System-Context/
* Rationale: Provides a stable, predictable, and language-agnostic structure that is exceptionally well-suited for automated parsing and navigation by AI agents.

### 2.2 Document Content Structure: arc42 Template

The primary README.md file within each Johnny.Decimal ID folder MUST be structured using the arc42 template. This ensures comprehensive and consistent documentation for every architectural component.

* Implementation: Use the 12 standard arc42 sections as Level 2 Markdown headings (##). If a section is not applicable, it must be included with the content "N/A" to maintain structural consistency for parsers.
* Reference: For a full list of the 12 sections, see (https://arc42.org/overview).

### 2.3 Visual Language: C4 Model as Code

All architectural diagrams MUST conform to the C4 model and be generated as code using Mermaid or PlantUML.

* Embedding: Diagram code (.puml or .mmd) should be embedded directly within the relevant arc42 Markdown file using fenced code blocks.
* Mapping to arc42:
  * Level 1 (System Context) diagrams go in arc42 Section 3: Context and Scope.
  * Level 2 (Container) diagrams go in arc42 Section 5: Building Block View.
  * Level 3 (Component) diagrams go in arc42 Section 5: Building Block View of the relevant component's document.
* Example Mermaid C4 Syntax:

  C4Context
  title System Context diagram for Internet Banking System
  Person(customer, "Banking Customer", "A customer of the bank")
  System(banking_system, "Internet Banking System", "Allows customers to view account info")
  Rel(customer, banking_system, "Uses")

### 2.4 Connective Tissue: Zettelkasten Linking

To create a navigable knowledge web, all documents MUST be interconnected using Zettelkasten-inspired linking principles.

* Link Format: Use standard, relative Markdown links: (path/to/file.md#heading). This ensures maximum portability and compatibility.
* Atomicity: Each document should represent a single, "atomic" idea or component to facilitate precise linking.
* Contextual Links: When creating a link, provide context. Instead of "see also," write "This component DEPENDS_ON the (./21.01_Auth-Service/README.md)."

## 3.0 Markdown Style Guide

* YAML Front Matter: Every document MUST begin with a YAML front matter block containing at least id, title, status, version, and tags.
* Headings: Use semantic headings (#, ##, ###) hierarchically. Do not skip levels.
* Code Blocks: All code blocks MUST be fenced with triple backticks and include a language identifier (e.g., ```python).
