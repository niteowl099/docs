## Article I: The Principle of Documentation as Truth

1. The Single Source of Truth: All project knowledge, including requirements, architectural decisions, design patterns, and operational procedures, shall be codified in version-controlled Markdown files within this repository. This documentation is the canonical source of truth.
2. Regenerative Knowledge: All derived knowledge stores (e.g., vector databases, knowledge graphs) are considered ephemeral caches. The system must be designed such that these stores can be completely and accurately regenerated from the Markdown source at any time.
3. Human and Machine Readability: All documentation must be structured for both human comprehension and reliable machine parsing. This is non-negotiable for automated ingestion and AI-driven analysis.

## Article II: The Principle of Subscription-First AI

1. Maximize Included Usage: All workflows shall prioritize the use of features and models included within existing paid subscriptions (GitHub Copilot Pro, Gemini Advanced Pro, ChatGPT for Education) to minimize marginal costs.
2. Strategic Use of Premium Allowances: The monthly allowance of "premium requests" (e.g., from GitHub Copilot Pro) is a finite, high-value resource. It shall be reserved for complex, agentic tasks where its capabilities provide a significant advantage over standard models.
3. Strategic Use of Free-Tier APIs: Pay-per-use APIs shall only be invoked through a routing mechanism that first utilizes the pooled free-tier allotments from providers like Google Cloud, Azure, Cohere, and Mistral. Direct, billable API calls are an explicit exception requiring justification.

## Article III: The Principle of IDE-Centric Orchestration

1. VS Code as the Hub: Visual Studio Code is the primary control plane for all development and orchestration activities.
2. IDE Agents as Primary Actors: The native AI assistants within VS Code (GitHub Copilot, Gemini Code Assist) are to be treated as the primary "agents." The system's intelligence is derived from providing these agents with superior, structured context via instruction and prompt files.
3. Persistence Through Documentation: To combat context window limitations and ensure task persistence, the state of any multi-step operation (e.g., plans, partial results, errors) must be written to a "live file" in the workspace. This file serves as an external memory that the agent can be re-prompted with to resume its task, ensuring no loss of progress.

## Article IV: The Principle of Governance and Oversight

1. Human-in-the-Loop: The developer is the ultimate authority. All significant file modifications, destructive actions, or execution of metered tasks proposed by an AI agent require explicit user confirmation.
2. Traceability: All AI-driven actions should be traceable back to a specific instruction file or prompt. The system must maintain logs of which agent performed which task and based on what instructions.
3. Continuous Improvement: The documentation, instruction files, and prompt templates are living artifacts. They must be regularly reviewed, refined, and improved based on the performance and output of the AI agents.
