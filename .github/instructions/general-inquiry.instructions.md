# General Inquiry Workflow

If the user's intent is a general question or request:

1. Extract the user's question or request as clearly as possible.
2. Search documentation, codebase, or other resources for the answer.
3. Provide a concise, accurate, and actionable response.
4. If the inquiry is ambiguous, ask the user for clarification.
5. If the inquiry matches another intent type, route to the appropriate instruction file.

> **Strict adherence:** Prioritize clarity, accuracy, and user satisfaction in all responses.
