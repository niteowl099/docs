# Error/Log Analysis Workflow

If the user's intent is to analyze errors or logs:

1. Parse and extract all error messages, stack traces, and relevant log details.
2. Summarize the observed issues and their context.
3. Suggest possible causes and next steps for debugging or resolution.
4. Reference [debugging.instructions.md](./debugging.instructions.md) for advanced debugging strategies.
5. Present findings and recommendations to the user in a single turn.

> **Strict adherence:** Provide actionable, concise, and prioritized guidance for error/log analysis.
