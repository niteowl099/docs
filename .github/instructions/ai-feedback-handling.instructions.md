# AI Feedback Handling Workflow

If the user's intent is to provide feedback on AI output or behavior:

1. Extract all feedback details, including specific examples or concerns.
2. Summarize the feedback and identify actionable items or improvement areas.
3. Propose changes to instructions, prompts, or workflows if needed.
4. Ask the user for confirmation or further clarification if the feedback is ambiguous.
5. Document the feedback and any resulting changes in the changelog or relevant files.

> **Strict adherence:** Always acknowledge feedback and seek to improve AI performance and user experience.
