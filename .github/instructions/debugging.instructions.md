# Debugging Workflow

1. Reproduce the issue and document the observed behavior.
2. Use Copilot to suggest possible causes and fixes.
3. Apply fixes incrementally, testing after each change.
4. If unresolved, escalate to a human reviewer.

## Copilot Debugging Prompts

- “Explain the error in this stack trace.”
- “Suggest possible causes for this bug.”
- “Generate a step-by-step debugging plan for this function.”
