# AI-Assisted Software Development Ecosystem: Master README

ID: 00.00
Status: Active
Version: 1.0.0

## 1.0 Introduction and Goals

This repository contains the complete documentation and operational framework for a next-generation, AI-assisted software development ecosystem. The primary goal is to create a persistent, intelligent, and cost-aware system that leverages subscription-based AI assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Gemini Code Assist) to their fullest potential, minimizing reliance on pay-per-use APIs.
This ecosystem is built on a core principle: "Documentation-as-Truth." This means the documentation in this repository is not a secondary artifact; it *is* the canonical source of truth from which all system behavior, context, and knowledge is derived. All other components, suchs as vector databases or knowledge graphs, are considered ephemeral representations that can be regenerated from this source.
The key objectives are:

* Maximize Subscription Value: Fully utilize the "unlimited" and "premium request" allowances of existing subscriptions like GitHub Copilot Pro and Gemini Advanced Pro.
* Strategic API Usage: Employ a pooled collection of free-tier APIs from providers like Google Cloud, Azure, and others for necessary API-driven tasks, managed by an intelligent router to stay within free usage limits.
* Eliminate Context Loss: Create a persistent knowledge base that ensures AI agents have access to all relevant project history, decisions, and standards, overcoming the limitations of finite context windows.
* IDE-Centric Operation: All development and orchestration should be manageable from within Visual Studio Code, using AI assistants as the primary interface.

## 2.0 Navigating This Repository: The Johnny.Decimal System

This repository is organized using the Johnny.Decimal system to ensure a stable, predictable, and language-agnostic structure that is exceptionally well-suited for AI navigation.
The hierarchy is as follows:

* 00-09 System Core & Meta: Contains the foundational documents defining the system itself (this file, the constitution, standards, etc.).
* 10-19 Architecture & Design: High-level architectural documentation, including C4 model diagrams and design principles.
* 20-29 MVS Bootstrap & Implementation: Contains the instruction files and plans for building the ecosystem.
* 30-39 Agent Definitions & Prompts: Contains the "source code" for our VS Code agentsâ€”their instruction sets and reusable prompt templates.
* 40-49 Projects: Documentation for specific software projects being developed *by* this ecosystem.
* 50-59 Research & Decision Logs: A repository for research notes (e.g., from Gemini Deep Research) and Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).
* 60-69 Governance & Monitoring: Contains documentation related to cost tracking, performance monitoring, and AI governance policies.

To get started, proceed to the System Constitution document: (10-19-Architecture-and-Design/10.01-System-Constitution.md).
