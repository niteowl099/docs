# How to Use This Documentation System

This document provides a guide to understanding and effectively using this documentation system.

## Core Principles

This system is organized around a few core principles:

*   **Johnny.Decimal:** A system for organizing projects with numerically indexed folders. This provides a clear, unambiguous structure.
*   **arc42 & C4 Model:** Standard templates and models for documenting software architecture, ensuring consistency and clarity.
*   **Zettelkasten:** An approach to note-taking that emphasizes atomic, linked notes to build a knowledge graph.
*   **Atomic Commits:** All changes should be committed in small, logical units with clear messages.

## Common Workflows

Here are links to instructions for common tasks:

*   **[Ingesting Google Docs](./instructions/ingest-gdoc-research.md):** How to transfer a research report from a Google Doc into the system.
*   **[Creating a New Component](./instructions/create-new-component.md):** The standard process for adding a new component to the system.
*   **[Generating Unit Tests](./prompts/generate-unit-tests.md):** A reusable prompt for creating unit tests.

## Getting Started

1.  Review the **[System Constitution](./10-19-Architecture-and-Design/10.01-System-Constitution.md)** to understand the overall vision.
2.  Familiarize yourself with the **[Documentation Standards](./10-19-Architecture-and-Design/10.02-Documentation-Standards.md)**.
3.  Explore the existing directories to understand the Johnny.Decimal structure in practice.
